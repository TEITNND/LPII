Cloud Computing ‚Äì Short Notes
üîπ Definition:
Cloud computing means delivering computing services (servers, storage, databases, apps) over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis.

üéØ Purpose of Cloud Computing:
‚úÖ Cost-Efficient: No need to buy/manage physical servers.

üìà Scalable: Easily scale resources up/down as needed.

üîí Secure: Offers encryption, firewalls, identity management.

üåê Global Access: Use services from anywhere with internet.

‚ö° Fast Deployment: Deploy apps in minutes worldwide.

üîÅ Reliable: High uptime, backups, disaster recovery.

üü® AWS (Amazon Web Services):
üåç Cloud platform by Amazon.

Offers 200+ services: compute (EC2), storage (S3), databases (RDS), serverless (Lambda).

Used by companies like Netflix, NASA, and startups.

Free Tier available for learning.

üü¶ GCP (Google Cloud Platform):
üîß Cloud platform by Google.

Key services: App Engine (GAE), Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery.

Best for web apps, ML/AI, and quick deployment.

Simpler interface, good for beginners.

üîÑ AWS vs GCP (Quick Comparison):

üî∑ What is GAE (Google App Engine) Launcher?
Google App Engine Launcher was a desktop GUI tool provided by Google as part of the Google Cloud SDK to simplify deploying Python (especially Python 2.7) web apps to Google App Engine. It was mainly used in earlier versions of GAE and is now deprecated, but the concept is still useful for understanding GAE-based deployment.



‚úÖ Purpose of Using GAE Launcher:
To deploy and run web applications (especially Python-based) on the Google App Engine platform.

Provides a graphical interface to:

Test web applications locally.

Deploy them to Google Cloud without command-line operations.

View logs and manage app versions.

üîç Key Benefits:
No server management: GAE handles infrastructure, scaling, and maintenance.

Auto-scaling: Automatically adjusts resources based on traffic.

Google-grade hosting: Fast and reliable hosting from Google.

Easy deployment: One-click deployment using the launcher.

√∏n google cloud all the oprion we can perform the localy than we can deploy it 
‚úÖ Note: GAE Launcher was primarily used with Python 2.7 apps. For modern apps, you now use the gcloud CLI.



An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of tools, libraries, documentation, code samples, and APIs provided by a platform or service to help developers create applications for that specific platform.

Examples:
Android SDK ‚Äì For building Android apps.

Firebase SDK ‚Äì For integrating Firebase services into apps.

Google Gemini SDK (@google/generative-ai) ‚Äì To use Gemini AI models in your app.

In short, an SDK is like a toolbox developers use to build apps more easily and correctly on a given platform or with a specific technology.

Would you like an example of how an SDK is used in a project?



**********************************************IMP****************************************


Typical Workflow:
Run the app locally using the green Run button.

Test the app by clicking Browse ‚Äì it opens http://localhost:8080.

After testing, click Deploy to upload it to your GCP App Engine.

Access it online via the URL assigned by GCP (e.g., https://your-project-id.appspot.com).

üåê After Deployment (On Cloud):
Once deployed:

The app runs 24/7 on Google's servers.

It can handle users from anywhere in the world.

You can view logs, scale the app, or update versions from the Google Cloud Console.



//***************************************************************************************
console google cloud 
create the project 
then enable it
then app engien admin api
go to cl0ud shell
then run the code there
cd ~/LP-II/CC/1-\ GAE\ Launcher/apps/ae-01-trivial
or you can do the cd "~/LP-II/CC/1- GAE Launcher/apps/ae-01-trivial"

we configerue the google cloud then we will run the code on it

Scalable, secure, and flexible

Powerful tools for backend, AI, and big data

Perfect for enterprise-grade apps



 Google App Engine (GAE)
What is it?
GAE is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) on GCP. It lets you deploy your web apps without managing servers.

Why use it?
Write code in Node.js, Python, Java, etc.

Just upload code ‚Üí GAE runs and scales it automatically

Built-in security, monitoring, and traffic handling

Ideal for hosted backend APIs (like verifying Firebase tokens)

Good for:
Hosting APIs, backend services

Projects that need to scale without server headaches

2. Find a procedure to transfer the files from one virtual 
machine to another virtual machine.  


Q1. What is virtualiza on? 
A: Virtualiza on is the crea on of virtual servers, devices, or resources that behave like real physical 
systems. It allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical machine, increasing efficiency and flexibility.



Q4. What is a hypervisor? 
A: A hypervisor (or Virtual Machine Monitor, VMM) is  software layer or firmware that creates and 
manages virtual machines. It allows mul ple guest OSes to run on a host system. 



 Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare Metal)
üìå Installed directly on the physical hardware.

‚ùå No host operating system is involved in managing virtual machines.

‚úÖ The hypervisor itself directly manages hardware and VMs.

Example: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V (bare metal), Xen, KVM

üß† Think of it as:

‚ÄúThe hypervisor is the OS.‚Äù

üî∂ Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted)
üìå Installed on top of a host operating system (like Windows or Linux).

‚úÖ Host OS manages the hardware, and

‚úÖ The hypervisor runs as a normal application within the host OS.

Example: Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, Parallels Desktop



Operating-system-level virtualization is a type of virtualization where the host OS kernel allows multiple isolated user-space instances, known as containers or virtual environments, to run on a single OS.


It's like running many mini virtual computers (containers) inside a single OS ‚Äî without needing multiple OS copies or full virtual machines.


3. What is hardware/pla orm virtualiza on? 
A: It refers to crea ng virtual machines that act like real computers. Soware runs independently of 
the underlying hardware on these virtual machines. 


Definition:
Hardware virtualization (also known as platform virtualization) is the process of creating virtual versions of physical hardware using a software called a hypervisor. This allows multiple operating systems to run simultaneously and independently on a single physical machine.


Q5. What are host and guest machines in virtualiza on? 
A: The host machine is the actual physical computer, and the guest machine is the virtual machine 
running on it


A VMDK image stands for Virtual Machine Disk. It is a file format developed by VMware to store the contents of a virtual hard drive used by a virtual machine (VM).


Q8. Why is crea ng a network necessary before launching an instance? 
A8. Without a network, the virtual machine (instance) cannot communicate or access the internet. 
OpenStack requires at least one network to launch and connect instances.



PaaS, SaaS, and IaaS are different service models in cloud computing, each offering varying levels of control, flexibility, and management. Here's a detailed explanation of each:

 Where They're Used:
SaaS is ideal for businesses that need ready-to-use applications like email, file sharing, and CRM.

PaaS is for developers building apps quickly without dealing with hardware.

IaaS is best for companies that need to run custom applications and manage their own infrastructure but want to avoid the complexity of physical servers.

1. SaaS (Software as a Service)
‚úÖ What is SaaS?
Software as a Service is a cloud computing model where software applications are hosted by a third-party provider and made available to users over the internet.


2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)
‚úÖ What is PaaS?
Platform as a Service provides a platform that allows developers to build, test, and deploy applications without managing the underlying hardware and software infrastructure.

PaaS includes development tools, databases, and middleware, and focuses on simplifying application development.

üîß Examples:
Google App Engine

Microsoft Azure App Services

Heroku

AWS Elastic Beanstalk



3. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
‚úÖ What is IaaS?
Infrastructure as a Service is a cloud computing model where cloud providers offer virtualized computing resources over the internet. It provides basic infrastructure like virtual machines, storage, networking, and other resources.

With IaaS, you manage the operating system, applications, and data, but the provider manages the physical hardware.



Q1. What is OpenStack? 
A1. OpenStack is an open-source cloud compu ng pla orm that provides Infrastructure-as-a-Service 
(IaaS). It allows users to create and manage virtual machines, storage, and networks using a 
dashboard or API.
